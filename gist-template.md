## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are regex tokens. These tokens are not matched with any characters, but they can assert information into the string of text. 
Syntax: 
* ^ matches the position before the first character in the string.
* $ matches right after the last character in the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are regex features, they are greedy lazy Possessive, sometimes fixed. Quantifiers indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.
Syntax: 
* {n}
* + 
* *
* ?

### OR Operator
The OR operator in regex is a boolean operator, it executes an operation task if one or more values ore match.
syntax: (||)

### Character Classes
Regex classes are called character class. 
The syntax: [ character class begins and ends with the brackets]
Unless noted the rules can change inside the brackets.

### Flags
Regex flags are modifiers. They are used to modify the behavior of the search.
Flags can be global and they can also ignore.
Syntax: i, g, //,  y, u, m

### Grouping and Capturing
Regex uses a pattern of enclosing information inside parentheses. This method is called capturing group.
Syntax: (....)

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are a unique type of character class in regex. They match one character out of a set of characters.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy describes the type of matching witch continues to search fo a match even after it is found.

### Boundaries
Boundaries or word boundaries are meta-character anchors. It is also a zero length match.
Syntax: \b

### Back-references
Back references in regex will match the same text which was previously matched by a capturing group.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and Look-behind are also known as 'look-around' together.
